        With a background in Industrial Maintenance Engineering from Yaba
        College of Technology, I took a bold leap into tech while still in
        school. This move sparked a passion for innovation and education. As a
        Robotics Instructor at WiFi Combat Academy (2021-2023), I empowered
        young minds with essential tech skills, including mobile app
        development, UI/UX design, and more. This experience not only honed my
        teaching skills but also deepened my understanding of emerging
        technologies. In 2022, I joined GO54 (formerly WhoGoHost) as a Customer
        Support Officer intern. Quickly proving myself to be an exceptional team
        member, leveraging my NodeJs web development expertise to resolve
        customer issues in real-time. I have continued to expand my skill set,
        exploring Cloud and DevOps practices. With a clear vision for the
        future, striving to become a Cloud or DevOps engineer, driving
        innovation and excellence in this field.
