# Exercise 2

**Task:** Research online for 10 more linux commands aside the ones already mentioned in this module. Submit using your altschool-cloud-exercises project, explaining what each command is used for with examples of how to use each and example screenshots of using each of them.

**Instruction:** Submit your work in a folder for this exercise in your altschool-cloud-exercises project. You will need to learn how to embed images in markdown files.
