      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        With a background in Industrial Maintenance Engineering from Yaba
        College of Technology, I took a bold leap into tech while still in
        school. This move sparked a passion for innovation and education. As a
        Robotics Instructor at WiFi Combat Academy (2021-2023), I empowered
        young minds with essential tech skills, including mobile app
        development, UI/UX design, and more. This experience not only honed my
        teaching skills but also deepened my understanding of emerging
        technologies. In 2022, I joined GO54 (formerly WhoGoHost) as a Customer
        Support Officer intern. Quickly proving myself to be an exceptional team
        member, leveraging my NodeJs web development expertise to resolve
        customer issues in real-time. I have continued to expand my skill set,
        exploring Cloud and DevOps practices. With a clear vision for the
        future, striving to become a Cloud or DevOps engineer, driving
        innovation and excellence in this field.

      <h2>Why I Joined AltSchool</h2>
      <p>
        I was motivated to join AltSchool due to my desire to learn about cloud
        and the effect of their training which was provided during my 3MTT
        training which introduced me to the basics of cloud engineering.

      <h2>Goals for the School of Engineering Program</h2>
      <p>
        My goal for the school is to aquire the needed cloud skills for my Cloud
        and Devops Engineering journey, and build relevant projects to showcase
        my skills to potential employers and possibly have a cloud solution that
        solves a problem.I also want to network with other students and
        instructors to learn from their experiences and build a strong network.
